# Give a solution for an assignment in [Rust By Example][assignment_source] Book 
The assigment is:
<p><B>It is not wise to let our number of threads depend on user inputted data. What if the user decides to insert a lot of spaces? Do we really want to spawn 2,000 threads? Modify the program so that the data is always chunked into a limited number of chunks, defined by a static constant at the beginning of the program.</B></p>
<p>If I want to name this project I should say:"Multi-Threaded Map-Reduce for Summing Digits in a String Witb Limited Number of Chunks.</p>
